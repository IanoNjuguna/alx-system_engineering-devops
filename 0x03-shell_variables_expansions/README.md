## 0x03. Shell, init files, variables and expansions

This directory contains my work for 0x03. Shell, init files, variables and expansions.

### Contents

0. A script that creates an alias. Name: ```ls```. Value: ```rm *```^[0].

1. A script that prints ```hello user```, where user is the current Linux user^[1].

2. A script that adds ```/action``` to the ```PATH```. ```/action``` should be the last directory the shell looks into when looking for a program^[2].

3. A script that counts the number of directories in the ```PATH```^[3].

4. A script that lists environment variables^[4].

5. A script that lists all local variables and environment variables, and functions^[5].

6. A script that creates a new local variable. Name: ```BEST```. Value: School^[6]

7. A script that creates a new global variable. Name: ```BEST```. Value: ```School```^[7]

8. A  script that prints the result of the addition of 128 with the value stored in the environment variable ```TRUEKNOWLEDGE```, followed by a new line^[8].

9. A script that prints the result of ```POWER``` divided by ```DIVIDE```, followed by a new line. ```POWER``` and ```DIVIDE``` are environment variables^[9].

10. A script that displays the result of ```BREATH``` to the power ```LOVE```. ```BREATH``` and ```LOVE``` are environment variables. The script should display the result, followed by a new line^[10].

11. A script that converts a number from base 2 to base 10. The number in base 2 is stored in the environment variable ```BINARY```. The script should display the number in base 10, followed by a new line^[11].

12. A script that prints all possible combinations of two letters, except ```oo```. Letters are lower cases, from ```a``` to ```z```.One combination per line. The output should be alpha ordered, starting with ```aa```. Do not print ```oo```. Your script file should contain maximum 64 characters^[12].

13. A script that prints a number with two decimal places, followed by a new line. The number will be stored in the environment variable ```NUM```^[13].

14. A script that converts a number from base 10 to base 16. The number in base 10 is stored in the environment variable ```DECIMAL```. The script should display the number in base 16, followed by a new line^[14].

15. A script that encodes and decodes text using the rot13 encryption. Assume ASCII^[15].

16. A script that prints every other line from the input, starting with the first line^[16].

17. A shell script that adds the two numbers stored in the environment variables ```WATER``` and ```STIR``` and prints the result. ```WATER``` is in base water. ```STIR``` is in base stir. The result should be in base ```bestchol```^[17].
